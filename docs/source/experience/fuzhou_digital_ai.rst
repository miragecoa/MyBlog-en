## Core AI Projects

### AI-Assisted Design Platform

**Project Background**: Provide AI-driven design solutions for textile and footwear industries, helping designers quickly generate and modify design drafts to improve design efficiency and innovation capabilities.

**Deployment**: https://utaidtest.fziip.com (Login required)

**My Responsibilities**:
- As AI Technology Consultant, responsible for the technical architecture design of the entire AI-assisted design platform
- Implement image generation workflows based on Stable Diffusion
- Develop professional image segmentation and editing functions
- Conduct model fine-tuning and optimization for vertical industry requirements

**Core AI Features**:
- **Text-to-Image**: Generate original design drafts based on text descriptions
- **Image-to-Image**: Generate new design proposals based on reference images
- **Inpainting**: Precisely edit specific regions of images
- **Super Resolution**: Enhance image resolution and quality
- **Virtual Try-on**: Virtual fitting effect display

**Technical Architecture**:
- **ComfyUI Workflows**: Design multiple professional AI generation workflows supporting complex design requirements
- **Stable Diffusion Models**: Integrate multiple versions of SD models for optimized generation effects
- **LoRA Fine-tuning**: Fine-tune models for professional terminology in textile and footwear industries (lace, jacquard, etc.)
- **SAM ViT-Large**: Implement precise image segmentation supporting user click-to-select redesign areas

**Industry Adaptation**:
- **Textile Industry**: Support generation of professional design elements like lace, jacquard, and prints
- **Footwear Industry**: Model optimization for specific shoe design requirements
- **Professional Terminology Processing**: Solve accurate understanding and image generation of industry-specific terms

**Supply Chain Coverage**:
The complete textile manufacturing process includes two critical stages:
- **Designers**: Responsible for original design creation (âœ… Solved by AI with 80% efficiency improvement)
- **Process Engineers**: Convert designs into machine-executable process workflows (ðŸ”¬ Currently under research)

We currently focus on AI solutions for the design stage, achieving significant results. The process engineering stage faces more complex technical challenges, including:
- **Continuous Path Planning**: Machines knit through line-by-line scanning, requiring uninterrupted thread paths
- **Thread Optimization**: Intelligent planning of single-stroke drawing paths from edges, minimizing non-pattern area paths
- **Software Integration**: Seamless adaptation with existing professional software systems used by process engineers

**Technical Challenges & Solutions**:
- **Professional Terminology Understanding**: Collected extensive industry-specific images and terminology, used LoRA technology for model fine-tuning
- **Image Quality Control**: Established multi-layer quality inspection mechanisms to ensure generated images meet professional design standards
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimized GPU usage efficiency to achieve high-performance services for multi-user concurrent access
- **User Experience**: Designed intuitive operation interfaces to lower usage barriers for professional designers

**Intelligent Annotation System Optimization**:

During project iterations, we faced a critical technical challenge: when users provided new training images containing professional elements like "jacquard," existing image annotation models could not automatically recognize and annotate these professional terms, leading to inefficient training data annotation.

*Technical Architecture*:
- **Multimodal Annotation**: Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct + SigLIP-So400m-patch14-384 (CLIP model)
- **Feature Adaptation**: ImageAdapter for image feature recognition and mapping
- **Fine-tuning Strategy**: Implemented ImageAdapter locking and end-to-end fine-tuning of CLIP models

*Core Challenge*:
Traditional end-to-end fine-tuning methods cannot effectively solve the automatic annotation problem of professional terminology. When the model encounters industry-specific terms like "jacquard," it lacks corresponding visual-semantic association training and cannot accurately identify and automatically generate corresponding labels. This results in manual annotation being required every time users provide new images containing professional elements, severely impacting training efficiency.

*Solution Exploration*:
To address this challenge, we are exploring annotation model optimization solutions based on few-shot learning and domain adaptation, researching how to enhance recognition capabilities for vertical domain professional terminology while maintaining model generalizability, to achieve accurate automatic annotation of professional terms.

**Project Achievements**:
- Successfully deployed a complete AI-assisted design platform
- Implemented a full design workflow from concept to finished product
- **Efficiency Improvement**: Saved 80% of design time for designers
- **Service Scale**: Provided AI services to 50+ enterprises with continuously growing client base
- Provided AI transformation technical support for traditional manufacturing industries
